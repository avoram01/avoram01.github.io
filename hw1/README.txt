Assignment 1 - Your Portfolio
README.txt

I created three web pages describing myself and my abilities. The home page is called index.html, which includes a picture of myself and links to the other two pages, resume.html and bio.html. I included all styling in only the css file provided, called style.css. In addition, I created a special repo for this assignment called avoram01.github.io. However, I was initially using my hello-world repo from Lab 2, so many of my commits are under that repository. I also created a directory in my CS account, so upon inputting https://cs.tufts.edu/~avoram01/, my index.html page is displayed.

I did not collaborate with anybody on this project, but Kenny (TA) helped me better understand how linking to other pages work.

I spent about 3 hours on this project.
